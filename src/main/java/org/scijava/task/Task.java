/**
 * A self-aware job which reports its status and progress as it runs.
 *
 * There are two ways to use a Task object:
 * - A job can be run asynchronously by using {@link Task#run(Runnable)}, and
 * can report its progression from within the Runnable.
 *
 * - A {@link Task} object can simply be used to report in a synchronous manner
 * the progression of a piece of code. In the case of synchronous reporting,
 * the job is considered started when {@link Task#start()} is called and
 * finished when {@link Task#finish()} is called. A finished job can be finished
 * either because it is done or because it has been cancelled.
 *
 * A cancel callback can be set with {@link Task#setCancelCallBack(Runnable)}.
 * The runnable argument will be executed in the case of an external event
 * requesting a cancellation of the task - typically, if a user clicks
 * a cancel button on the GUI, task.cancel("User cancellation requested") will
 * be called. As a result, the task implementors should run the callback.
 * This callback can be used to make the task aware that a cancellation
 * has been requested, and should proceed to stop its execution.
 *
 * See also {@link TaskService}, {@link DefaultTask}
