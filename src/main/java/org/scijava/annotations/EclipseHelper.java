/**
 * Helps Eclipse's lack of support for annotation processing in incremental
 * build mode.
 * <p>
 * Eclipse has a very, let's say, "creative" way to interpret the Java
 * specifications when it comes to annotation processing: while Java mandates
 * that annotation processors need to be run after compiling Java classes,
 * Eclipse cops out of that because it poses a challenge to its incremental
 * compilation (and especially to Eclipse's attempt at compiling .class files
 * even from .java sources that contain syntax errors).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So we need to do something about this. Our strategy is to detect when the
 * annotation index was not updated properly and just do it ourselves, whenever
 * {@link Index#load(Class)} is called.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since our aim here is to compensate for Eclipse's shortcoming, we need only
 * care about the scenario where the developer launches either a Java main class
 * or a unit test from within Eclipse, and even then only when the annotation
 * index is to be accessed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The way Eclipse launches Java main classes or unit tests, it makes a single
 * {@link URLClassLoader} with all the necessary class path elements. Crucially,
 * the class path elements corresponding to Eclipse projects will never point to
 * {@code .jar} files but to directories. This allows us to assume that the
 * annotation classes as well as the annotated classes can be loaded using that
 * exact class loader, too.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is quite possible that a developer may launch a main class in a different
 * project than the one which needs annotation indexing, therefore we need to
 * inspect all class path elements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To provide at least a semblance of a performant component, before going all
 * out and indexing the annotations, we verify that the {@code META-INF/json/}
 * directory has an outdated timestamp relative to the {@code .class} files. If
 * that is not the case, we may safely assume that the annotation indexes are
 * up-to-date.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To avoid indexing class path elements over and over again which simply do not
 * contain indexable annotations, we make the {@code META-INF/json/} directory
 * nevertheless, updating the timestamp to reflect that we indexed the
 * annotations.
 * </p>
