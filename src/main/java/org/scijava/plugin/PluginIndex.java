/**
 * Data structure for managing registered plugins.
 * <p>
 * The plugin index is a special type of {@link org.scijava.object.ObjectIndex}
 * that classifies each {@link PluginInfo} object into a type hierarchy
 * compatible with its associated <em>plugin</em> type (i.e.,
 * {@link PluginInfo#getPluginType()}), rather than {@link PluginInfo}'s type
 * hierarchy (i.e., {@link PluginInfo}, {@link org.scijava.UIDetails},
 * {@link org.scijava.Instantiable}, etc.).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: This type hierarchy will typically <em>not</em> include the plugin class
 * itself; for example, the {@link org.scijava.plugin.DefaultPluginService} has
 * a plugin type of {@link org.scijava.service.Service}, and hence will be
 * categorized beneath {@code Service.class}, not
 * {@code DefaultPluginService.class} or {@code PluginService.class}. The
 * rationale is that to fully classify each plugin including its own class, said
 * class would need to be loaded, which SciJava makes an effort not to do until
 * the plugin is actually needed for the first time.
