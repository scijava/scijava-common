/**
 * Interface for plugins which "handle" a particular subset of data objects. A
 * handler plugin is a {@link SingletonPlugin} associated with a specific data
 * type (i.e., implementing {@link TypedPlugin}).
 * <p>
 * For a given data object (of type {@code D}), the {@code HandlerPlugin}
 * declares whether it can handle that data object via the {@link #supports}
 * method. The plugin's associated {@link HandlerService#getHandler} method then
 * uses this capability to determine the most appropriate handler for any given
 * data object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that there is no single {@code handle(D)} method for actually handling
 * data objects, because it would be rather inflexible; e.g., handlers may have
 * other required inputs, or may provide more than one possible avenue of
 * handling (i.e., more than one "handle"-style method).
 * </p>
