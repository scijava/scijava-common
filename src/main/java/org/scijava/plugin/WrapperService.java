 * sequentially querying each {@link WrapperPlugin} on its list for
 * compatibility.

 * Note that like {@link PTService}, {@link SingletonService} and
 * {@link TypedService}, {@code WrapperService} is not a service interface
 * defining API for a specific concrete service implementation, but rather a
 * more general layer in a type hierarchy intended to ease creation of services
 * that fit its pattern.
