/**
 * Top-level interface for plugins. Plugins discoverable at runtime must
 * implement this interface and be annotated with @{@link Plugin}.
 * <p>
 * What all plugins have in common is that they are declared using an annotation
 * (@{@link Plugin}), and discovered if present on the classpath at runtime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The core types of plugins are as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.app.App} - metadata about a SciJava application.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.command.Command} - plugins that are executable. These
 * plugins typically perform a discrete operation, and are accessible via the
 * application menus.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.console.ConsoleArgument} - plugins that handle
 * arguments passed to the application as command line parameters.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.convert.Converter} - plugins which translate objects
 * between data types.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.display.Display} - plugins that visualize objects,
 * often used to display module outputs.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.io.IOPlugin} - plugins that read or write data.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.module.process.PreprocessorPlugin} - plugins that
 * perform preprocessing on modules. A preprocessor plugin is a discoverable
 * {@link org.scijava.module.process.ModulePreprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.module.process.PostprocessorPlugin} - plugins that
 * perform postprocessing on modules. A
 * {@link org.scijava.module.process.PostprocessorPlugin} is a discoverable
 * {@link org.scijava.module.process.ModulePostprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.platform.Platform} - plugins for defining
 * platform-specific behavior.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.script.ScriptLanguage} - plugins that enable executing
 * scripts in particular languages as SciJava modules.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.service.Service} - plugins that define new API in a
 * particular area.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.tool.Tool} - plugins that map user input (e.g.,
 * keyboard and mouse actions) to behavior. They are usually rendered as icons
 * in the application toolbar.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.widget.InputWidget} - plugins that render UI widgets
 * for the {@link org.scijava.widget.InputHarvester} preprocessor.</li>
 * </ul>
