/**
 * Interface for convenience classes that wrap a {@link Context} to provide
 * one-line access to a suite of {@link Service}s.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #get} methods provide consistent {@link Service} instantiation,
 * while throwing {@link NoSuchServiceException} if the requested
 * {@link Service} is not found.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sample implementation: let's say we have a {@code Kraken} Service and 
 * a {@code Cow} Service. Using an existing Context, the code would look like:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * context.getService(Cow.class).moo();
 * context.getService(Kraken.class).rawr();</pre>
 * <p>
 * But if we create an AnimalGateway class with the following signatures:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * public Cow cow() { return get(Cow.class); }
 * public Kraken kraken() { return get(Kraken.class); }</pre>
 * <p>
 * We can now access our Services through the new Gateway:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * AnimalGateway.cow().feedToKraken();
 * AnimalGateway.kraken().burp();</pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that this also hides the dependencies on the Cow and Kraken services.
