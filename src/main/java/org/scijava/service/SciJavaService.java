 * Marker interface for core SciJava Common {@link Service}s.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is not intended to be extended by non-core service
 * interfaces, because it serves as a marker for core SciJava Common services
 * <em>only</em>. The idea is that this interface can be used to create a
 * {@link Context} containing core SciJava services using the invocation:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * final Context context = new Context(SciJavaService.class);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If you have a collection of services which you want to be grouped similarly,
 * just create your own marker interface for the same purpose.
