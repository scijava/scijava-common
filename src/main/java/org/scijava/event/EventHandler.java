/**
 * Annotation identifying an event handler method. This annotation allows a
 * class to subscribe to multiple types of events by implementing multiple event
 * handling methods and annotating each with @{@link EventHandler}.
 * <p>
 * Note to developers: This annotation serves exactly the same purpose as
 * EventBus's {@link org.scijava.event.bushe.annotation.EventSubscriber}
 * annotation, recapitulating a subset of the same functionality. We do this to
 * avoid third party code depending directly on EventBus. That is, we do not
 * wish to require SciJava developers to {@code import org.scijava.event.bushe.*}
 * or similar. In this way, EventBus is isolated as only a transitive dependency
 * of downstream code, rather than a direct dependency. Unfortunately, because
 * Java annotation interfaces cannot utilize inheritance, we have to
 * recapitulate the functionality rather than extend it (as we are able to do
 * with {@link EventSubscriber}).

	 * code exists that handles an event in an undesirable way, that logic can be
	 * completely intercepted and overridden by writing more code that handles the
