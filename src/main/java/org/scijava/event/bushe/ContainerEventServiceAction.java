/**
 * When fired, this action publishes an ActionEvent on a Container EventService.
 * See {@link EventServiceAction} for more information.
 * <p/>
 * By default, the Container EventService is found by asking the ContainerEventServiceFinder to find the EventService
 * for the source of the fired ActionEvent, which must be a java.awt.Component and contained in a hierarchy (the source
 * must have been added to another Swing container).  If the action was on a button, this means the container hierarchy
 * of the button is walked (up) until a ContainerEventServiceSupplier is found or until the top of the hierarchy is
 * reached, at which point a ContainerEventService is created automatically on the fly via the top container's
 * putClientProperty() method using the key {@link ContainerEventServiceFinder#CLIENT_PROPERTY_KEY_TOP_LEVEL_EVENT_SERVICE}.
 * If the event is from a JPopupMenu then the popup menu's invoker's hierarchy is walked.
 * <p/>
 * To exhibit other behavior, override the getSwingEventService() to return another EventService. For example, the
 * creator of a popup menu may pass itself to the ContainerEventServiceFinder to return a parent's EventService.
 * <p/>
