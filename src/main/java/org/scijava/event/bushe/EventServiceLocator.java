/**
 * A central registry of EventServices.  Used by the {@link EventBus}.
 * <p/>
 * By default will lazily hold a SwingEventService, which is mapped to {@link #SERVICE_NAME_SWING_EVENT_SERVICE} and
 * returned by {@link #getSwingEventService()}.  Also by default this same instance is returned by {@link #getEventBusService()},
 * is mapped to {@link #SERVICE_NAME_EVENT_BUS} and wrapped by the EventBus.
 * <p/>
 * Since the default EventService implementation is thread safe, and since it's not good to have lots of events on the
 * EventDispatchThread you may want multiple EventServices running on multiple threads, perhaps pulling events from a
 * server and coalescing them into one or more events that are pushed onto the EDT.
 * <p/>
 * To change the default implementation class for the EventBus' EventService, use the API:
 * <pre>
 * EventServiceLocator.setEventService(EventServiceLocator.SERVICE_NAME_EVENT_BUS, new SomeEventServiceImpl());
 * </pre>
 * Or use system properties by:
 * <pre>
 * System.setProperty(EventServiceLocator.SERVICE_NAME_EVENT_BUS, YourEventServiceImpl.class.getName());
 * </pre>
 * Likewise, you can set this on the command line via -Dorg.scijava.event.bushe.swingEventServiceClass=foo.YourEventServiceImpl
 * <p/>
 * To change the default implementation class for the SwingEventService, use the API:
