/**
 * This class finds a component's container event service, and creates one if necessary and possible.
 * <p/>
 * A Container EventService is, unlike the EventBus, an EventService that is container specific, in other words, it is
 * shared only amongst components within a container.  For example, a Form component can supply an EventService used
 * only by components in the form.  The Form's components can publish value change events on their Container's Event
 * Service.  The Form's Model and Validator may listen to these events to collect data and show errors, respectively.
 * <p/>
 * Most importantly, Container EventService's cuts down event traffic, avoid naming and listener clashes, promotes
 * componentization, and splits events usage into logical subsets.
 * <p/>
 * The finder will walk up a component's hierarchy searching for a parent that implements ContainerEventServiceSupplier.
 * If it find one, it returns it.  If it doesn't find one, the top level JComponent (specifically, the highest parent in
 * the hierarchy, typically a JRootPane) has a client property added to it (if not already set) that has the value of a
 * new SwingEventService, which is then returned.  The EventBus is never returned.
