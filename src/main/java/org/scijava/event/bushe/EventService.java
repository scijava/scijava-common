/**
 * The core interface.  An EventService provides publish/subscribe services to a single JVM using Class-based and
 * String-based (i.e. "topic") publications and subscriptions.
 * <p>
 * In class-based pub/sub, {@link EventSubscriber}s subscribe to a type on an {@link EventService}, such
 * as the {@link org.scijava.event.bushe.EventBus}, by providing a class, interface or generic type.  The EventService
 * notifies subscribers when objects are published on the EventService with a matching type.  Full class semantics are
 * respected.  That is, if a subscriber subscribes to a class, the subscriber is notified if an object of
 * that class is publish or if an object of a subclass of that class is published. Likewise if a subscriber subscribes
 * to an interface, it will be notified if any object that implements that interface is published.  Subscribers can
 * subscribe "exactly" using  {@link #subscribeExactly(Class, EventSubscriber)} so that they are notified only if an
 * object of the exact class is published (and will not be notified if subclasses are published, since this would not
 * be "exact")
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In topic-based pub/sub, an object "payload" is published on a topic name (String).  {@link EventTopicSubscriber}s subscribe
 * to either the exact name of the topic or they may subscribe using a Regular Expression that is used to match topic
 * names.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the <a href="../../../../overview-summary.html#overview_description">overview</a> for an general introduction
 * and <a href="package-summary.html">package documentation</a> for usage details and examples.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A single subscriber cannot subscribe more than once to an event or topic name.  EventService implementations should
 * handle double-subscription requests by returning false on subscribe().  A single EventSubscriber can subscribe to more
 * than one event class, and a single EventTopicSubscriber can subscribe to more than one topic name or pattern. A
 * single object may implement both EventSubscriber and EventTopicSubscriber interfaces.  Subscribers are guaranteed to
 * only be called for the classes and/or topic names they subscribe to.  If a subscriber subscribes to a topic and to a
 * regular expression that matches the topic name, this is considered two different subscriptions and the subscriber
 * will be called twice for the publication on the topic.  Similarly, if a subscriber subscribes to a class and its
 * subclasses using subscribe() and again to a class of the same type using subscribeExactly(), this is considered two
 * different subscriptions and the subscriber will be called twice for the publication for a single event of the exact
 * type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default the EventService only holds WeakReferences to subscribers.  If a subscriber has no references to it, then
 * it can be garbage collected.  This avoids memory leaks in exchange for the risk of accidentally adding a listener and
 * have it disappear unexpectedly.  If you want to subscribe a subscriber that will have no other reference to it, then
 * use one of the subscribeStrongly() methods, which will prevent garbage collection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unless garbage collected, EventSubscribers will remain subscribed until they are passed to one of the unsubscribe()
 * methods with the event class or topic name to which there are subscribed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subscribers are called in the order in which they are subscribed by default (FIFO), unless subscribers implement
 * {@link Prioritized}.  Those subscribers that implement Prioritized and return a negative priority are moved to the
 * front of the list (the more negative, the more to the front).  Those subscribers that implement Prioritized and return
 * a positive priority are moved to the end of the list (the more positive, the more to the back).  The FIFO guarantee
 * is only valid for the same subscribe() call.  That is, the order of two subscribers, one to List.class and the other
 * to ArrayList.class is not guaranteed to be in the order of subscription when an ArrayList is published.  The same is
 * true for topic subscribers when using RegEx expressions - when "Foo" is published, the order of subscribers that are
 * subscribed to "Foo", "Fo*" and "F*" are not guaranteed, though the second "Fo*" subscriber will never be called
 * before the first "Fo*" subscriber (ditto List and ArrayList). Prioritized subscribers are always guaranteed to be in
 * the order of priority, no matter the call or the resulting mix of subscribers.  All ordering rules apply to all
 * types subscribers: class, topic, pattern, veto, etc.  For Swing users, note that FIFO is
 * the opposite of Swing, where event listeners are called in the reverse order of when they were subscribed (FILO).    
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Publication on a class or topic name can be vetoed by a {@link VetoEventListener}. All VetoEventListeners are checked
 * before any EventSubscribers or EventTopicSubscribers are called. This is unlike the JavaBean's
 * VetoPropertyEventListener which can leave side effects and half-propogated events. VetoEventListeners are subscribed
 * in the same manner as EventSubscribers and EventTopicSubscribers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The state of a published event can be tracked if an event or a topic's payload object implements the
 * {@link org.scijava.event.bushe.PublicationStatus} interface.  EventServices are required to set such objects'
 * {@link org.scijava.event.bushe.PublicationStatus} at the appropriate times during publication.
 * </p>
* <p>
 * This simple example prints "Hello World"
 * <pre>
 * EventService eventService = new ThreadSafeEventService();
 * //Create a subscriber
 * EventTopicSubscriber subscriber = new EventTopicSubscriber() {
 *    public void onEvent(String topic, Object event) {
 *        System.out.println(topic+" "+event);
 *    }
 * });
 * eventService.subscribe("Hello", subscriber);
 * eventService.publish("Hello", "World");
 * System.out.println(subscriber + " Since the reference is used after it is subscribed, it doesn't get garbage collected, this is not necessary if you use subscribeStrongly()");
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Events and/or topic data can be cached, but are not by default.  To cache events or topic data, call
 * {@link #setDefaultCacheSizePerClassOrTopic(int)}, {@link #setCacheSizeForEventClass(Class, int)}, or
 * {@link #setCacheSizeForTopic(String, int)}, {@link #setCacheSizeForTopic(Pattern, int)}.  Retrieve cached values
 * with {@link #getLastEvent(Class)}, {@link #getLastTopicData(String)}, {@link #getCachedEvents(Class)}, or
 * {@link #getCachedTopicData(String)}.  Using caching while subscribing is most likely to make sense only if you
 * subscribe and publish on the same thread (so caching is very useful for Swing applications since both happen on
 * the EDT in a single-threaded manner). In multithreaded applications, you never know if your subscriber has handled
 * an event while it was being subscribed (before the subscribe() method returned) that is newer or older than the
 * retrieved cached value (taken before or after subscribe() respectively).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is nothing special about the term "Event," this could just as easily be called a "Message" Service, this term
 * is already taken by the JMS, which is similar, but is used across processes and networks.
 * </p>
