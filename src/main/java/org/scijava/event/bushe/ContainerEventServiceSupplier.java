/**
 * A interface implemented by a Swing Container to supply an EventService local to it's child components.
 * <p/>
 * A Container EventService is an {@link EventService} which, unlike the {@link EventBus}, is specific to a container,
 * in other words, it is shared only among components within a Swing Container.  The only difference between a Container
 * EventService and any other EventService is that it's found and used by the children of a container.  The API and
 * available implementations all work the same as any other EventService.
 * <p/>
 * A good candidate for a ContainerEventServiceSupplier is a Form class.  The components that the Form contains can
 * publish objects when they they change state - for example when their values change or when they become invalid or
 * valid.  The Form may have a model that collects the user's entries by subscribing to events published on the Form's
 * EventService. A FormValidator may also listen to publications on the Form's EventService to subscribe to validation
 * errors.  The Form's components don't have to know about the form, or the model or the validator.  They just publish
 * events on their Container's EventService, which they can find by using a {@link ContainerEventServiceFinder}.
 * <p/>
 * This class does not ever have to be implemented or used directly.  The ContainerEventServiceFinder will create a
 * ContainerEventService on JRootPanes by default on demand.  Hence, each dialog and Frame will have their own
 * automatically as needed.  You only want to implement this interface when you want to limit events to subscribers
 * in containers smaller than a JRootPane, such as a Form's JPanel.
